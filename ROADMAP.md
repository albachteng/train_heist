# Train Heist Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development strategy for the Train Heist game engine and prototype.

## üéØ Development Strategy: Two-Track Approach

We're using a **two-track approach** that delivers value quickly while building foundational components:

- **Track 2**: Core Components (build universal ECS components in parallel)

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 0: ECS Foundation)
- **ECS Core**: Entity/component management with bitmask tracking
- **Systems Layer**: Priority-based system execution with dependency injection  
- **Event System**: Typed event queues for decoupled communication
- **Component Registry**: Automatic bit assignment for component types
- **SystemUtils**: Helper functions for common ECS operations
- **Logging System**: Multi-level logging with console/file output and global macros
- **Transform Components**: Position, Rotation, Scale, GridPosition with 2.5D coordinate utilities ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Test Coverage**: 120 passing tests with comprehensive coverage

### üöß In Progress

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### **Component Organization Strategy**
- **Include in `engine/ecs/components/`**: Transform, basic physics, core rendering components
- **Include in `engine/logging/`**: Logging system for runtime visibility and debugging
- **Keep in `game/components/`**: Train-specific logic, game rules, level-specific data
- **Clean Separation**: Engine components are generic and reusable, game components are domain-specific

### **Development Principles**
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write failing tests before implementation
2. **Visual Feedback First**: Prioritize getting something on screen quickly
3. **Incremental Integration**: Add complexity gradually while maintaining working state
4. **Game-Driven Design**: Every component gets tested in actual gameplay usage
5. **Visibility-First Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for understanding runtime behavior
6. **2.5D-Ready Architecture**: Design coordinate systems and rendering from the start to accommodate isometric projection

### **2.5D Isometric Architecture**
Key design considerations built into the foundation:

**Coordinate Systems:**
- **Grid Coordinates**: Logical game world positions (e.g., `GridPosition { int x, y; }`)
- **World Coordinates**: 3D positions for rendering depth (`Position { float x, y, z; }`) 
- **Screen Coordinates**: Final 2D pixel positions after isometric projection

**Component Design for 2.5D:**
```cpp
struct Position { float x, y, z; };        // 3D world position
struct GridPosition { int x, y; };         // Logical grid coordinates  
struct Depth { float value; };             // Explicit depth for sorting
struct IsometricSprite {                   // Isometric-aware rendering
    TextureID texture;
    float anchorX, anchorY;                // Anchor point for isometric alignment
};
```

**Rendering Pipeline Design:**
1. **Grid Logic**: Game rules operate on grid coordinates
2. **World Transform**: Grid ‚Üí 3D world coordinates  
3. **Isometric Projection**: 3D world ‚Üí 2D screen coordinates
4. **Depth Sorting**: Z-order sprites for proper layering
5. **SFML Rendering**: 2D sprite drawing (Phase 1-3)
6. **OpenGL Effects**: Shaders and effects (Phase 4)

### **Logging System Design**
The logging system will provide essential runtime visibility:

**Core Features:**
- **Multiple Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR with runtime filtering
- **Multiple Outputs**: Console, file, or both simultaneously
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with compile-time level filtering
- **Thread-Safe**: Prepared for future multi-threading support
- **ECS Integration**: Easy logging from systems with entity context

**Usage Pattern:**
```cpp
LOG_INFO("EntityManager", "Created entity {} with {} components", entity.id, componentCount);
LOG_WARN("Physics", "Entity {} moved out of bounds at ({}, {})", entity.id, pos.x, pos.y);
LOG_ERROR("Renderer", "Failed to load texture: {}", filename);
```

## üìà Metrics and Success Tracking

### **Technical Metrics**
- Test coverage: Currently 120 passing tests (95 ECS + 15 Logging + 10 Systems)
- Build time: Target <10 seconds for incremental builds
- Frame rate: Target 60 FPS for simple scenes

### **Feature Milestones**
- **Milestone 1**: Moving square (validates full stack integration)
- **Milestone 2**: Grid-based game with multiple entities
- **Milestone 3**: Playable train heist prototype
